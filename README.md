Smart Water App
=====================

A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

Go to the project folder and run `npm` to install all modules:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then add a platform:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
```

Build the project:

```bash
$ ionic build ios
```
And emulate to see the app:

```bash
$ ionic emulate ios
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
